# All-In-One (AIO) SDK Project version 1.1.1 with extra Share AMP

This AIO project contains an extra Share AMP module (share-amp) that is
included/overlayed on the Share WAR. The standard SDK 1.1.1 AIO project
does not contain any Share AMP project so it is not possible to
do any Share customizations without including them in the Share WAR project.

It is also easy to misunderstand and put Share extension code into the
amp module, which is Repository AMP module, and is included/overlayed on the Alfresco WAR.

This project contains some code/customizations from the https://angelborroy.wordpress.com/2015/04/24/customizing-alfresco-for-demo-purposes/
article. Note that the Aikau customizations at the end is not possible with
version 4.2.f as it does not have Aikau code more then in menu and title.
